You have been extremely helpful in laying out a plan for this project and helping me set up accounts, file structures, working environments, and code. I'm extremely appreciative for your help. At this point, I want to hand this off to a human developer. Can you provide a detailed and thorough report of the project layout, the steps we have taken so far, the remaining steps, and the all technical details that the human developer will need to complete this application?

Can you include everything in the initial Project Outline and Handover Report in addition to everything we have worked on in this chat, and a detailed plan for completion of future tasks? Please be thorough and include as much detail as possible to make it clear for the human developer.
