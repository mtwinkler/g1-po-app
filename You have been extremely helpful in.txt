You have been extremely helpful with this project. I'm extremely appreciative for your help. At this point, I want to hand this off to a human developer. Can you provide a detailed and thorough report of the project layout, the steps we have taken so far, the remaining steps, and the all technical details that the human developer will need to complete this application?

Can you include everything in the initial Handover Report in addition to everything we have worked on in this chat, and a detailed plan for completion of future tasks? Please be thorough and include as much detail as possible to make it clear for the human developer.
